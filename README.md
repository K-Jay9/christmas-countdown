### 1. Christmas countdown

This is just a countdown to the nearest Christmass.
Inspired by Florin Pop.
The app is made using vanilla `Javascript` and basic `HTML ` and `CSS`.

Opening the Html file with your browser is the easies way to view the application.

The App is part of commitment to make **100** vanilla `Javascript` projects.
